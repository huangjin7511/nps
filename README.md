## Introduction

NPS is a lightweight and efficient NAT traversal and reverse proxy system for exposing services behind NAT or firewalls. It supports multiple protocols such as TCP, UDP, HTTP, HTTPS, and SOCKS5, and provides a Web management interface for convenient deployment and monitoring.

Based on the original [NPS](https://github.com/ehang-io/nps) project, **NPS Enhanced** has evolved into an actively maintained and extensively improved edition with continuous refactoring, better stability, and many practical enhancements for modern deployment scenarios.

---

## Key Features

- **Multi-Protocol Support**  
  Supports TCP/UDP forwarding, HTTP/HTTPS reverse proxy, HTTP/SOCKS5 proxy, P2P mode, Proxy Protocol support, HTTP/3 support, and more for different private-network access scenarios.

- **Cross-Platform Deployment**  
  Compatible with major platforms such as Linux and Windows, and can be easily installed as a system service.

- **Web Management Interface**  
  Provides real-time monitoring of traffic, connection status, and client states with an intuitive and user-friendly interface.

- **Security and Extensibility**  
  Built-in features such as encrypted transmission, traffic limiting, access expiration controls, certificate management, and certificate renewal help improve security and manageability.

- **Multiple Connection Protocols**  
  Supports connecting to the server using TCP, KCP, TLS, QUIC, WS, and WSS protocols.

---

## What's New in v0.35.0

- **Node control plane and multi-platform management**
  Adds the public `/api/*` management surface for external platforms, including snapshots, batch requests, config export/import, and scoped actor access.

- **Direct, reverse, and dual platform connectivity**
  Supports reverse WebSocket channels, callback delivery, retry queues, replay, signing, and change-window based resynchronization for platform integrations.

- **Management workflow refactor**
  Reorganizes the management UI and service layer around users, clients, tunnels, hosts, and node-facing operations.

- **Reliability and code quality improvements**
  Cleans up race conditions, lint findings, persistence edge cases, and test coverage across P2P, mux, proxy, and runtime paths.

## Installation and Usage

For more detailed configuration options, please refer to the [Documentation](https://d-jy.net/docs/nps/).

### [Android](https://github.com/djylb/npsclient) | [OpenWrt](https://github.com/djylb/nps-openwrt)

### Docker Deployment

**DockerHub:** [NPS](https://hub.docker.com/r/duan2001/nps) | [NPC](https://hub.docker.com/r/duan2001/npc)

**GHCR:** [NPS](https://github.com/djylb/nps/pkgs/container/nps) | [NPC](https://github.com/djylb/nps/pkgs/container/npc)

> If you need to obtain the real client IP, you can use it together with [mmproxy](https://github.com/djylb/mmproxy-docker). For example: SSH.

#### NPS Server

```bash
docker pull duan2001/nps
docker run -d --restart=always --name nps --net=host -v $(pwd)/conf:/conf -v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro duan2001/nps
```

> **Tip:** After installing NPS, edit `nps.conf` (for example: listening ports and Web admin credentials) before starting the service.

#### NPC Client

```bash
docker pull duan2001/npc
docker run -d --restart=always --name npc --net=host duan2001/npc -server=xxx:123,yyy:456 -vkey=key1,key2 -type=tls,tcp -log=off
```

> **Tip:** Get `-server`, `-vkey`, and `-type` from the client page in the NPS Web UI to avoid manual input mistakes.

### Server Installation

#### Linux

```bash
# Install (default configuration path: /etc/nps/; binary file path: /usr/bin/)
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/djylb/nps/refs/heads/master/install.sh | sudo sh -s nps
nps install
nps start|stop|restart|uninstall

# Update
nps update && nps restart
```

> **Tip:** For first-time setup, edit `/etc/nps/nps.conf` and verify it before running `nps start`.

#### Windows

> If you do not want to choose the architecture, legacy package, or install path manually, use the repository root `install.ps1`.
>
> Windows 7 / 8 / 8.1 users should use the version ending with old: [64](https://github.com/djylb/nps/releases/latest/download/windows_amd64_server_old.tar.gz) / [32](https://github.com/djylb/nps/releases/latest/download/windows_386_server_old.tar.gz)

```powershell
.\install.ps1 nps
.\nps.exe install
.\nps.exe start|stop|restart|uninstall

# Update
.\nps.exe stop
.\nps-update.exe update
.\nps.exe start
```

### Client Installation

#### Linux

```bash
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/djylb/nps/refs/heads/master/install.sh | sudo sh -s npc
/usr/bin/npc install -server=xxx:123,yyy:456 -vkey=xxx,yyy -type=tls -log=off
npc start|stop|restart|uninstall

# Update
npc update && npc restart
```

> **Tip:** For `npc install`, use the command generated on the client page in the NPS Web UI.

#### Windows

> If you do not want to choose the architecture, legacy package, or install path manually, use the repository root `install.ps1`.
>
> Windows 7 / 8 / 8.1 users should use the version ending with old: [64](https://github.com/djylb/nps/releases/latest/download/windows_amd64_client_old.tar.gz) / [32](https://github.com/djylb/nps/releases/latest/download/windows_386_client_old.tar.gz)

```powershell
.\install.ps1 npc
.\npc.exe install -server="xxx:123,yyy:456" -vkey="xxx,yyy" -type="tls,tcp" -log="off"
.\npc.exe start|stop|restart|uninstall

# Update
.\npc.exe stop
.\npc-update.exe update
.\npc.exe start
```

> **Tip:** The client supports connecting to multiple servers simultaneously. Example:
> `npc -server=xxx:123,yyy:456,zzz:789 -vkey=key1,key2,key3 -type=tcp,tls`
> Here, `xxx:123` uses TCP, and `yyy:456` and `zzz:789` use TLS.

> If you need to connect to older server versions, add `-proto_version=0` to the startup command.
